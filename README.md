# Swiftui Combine tab demo

## Why?

1. Swiftui tab view dont allow more than 6 tabs
2. when another tab is selected, swiftui delete all the other views and thus those need to be reloaded when selected again
3. There are many bugs and confusion regarding view data type, this sets all the view as AnyView type, removing the need to check every time

## Usage

1. copy the folder TabBarElements into your project
2. edit file Tabs and TabBarControllerView.swift to show your swiftui view
